     * Challenge 2: User Input
     * ---
     * Variables:
     * String name
     * Integer damage
     * Integer hp
     * 
     * Task:
     * Read all variable values from User Input.
     * If the damage is greater than or equal to hp, print that the user has died.
     * If the damage is less than hp, print that user survived.
     * 
     * Bonus 1:
     * Create a new double variable critChance.
     * 1. The user enters a decimal number between 0 and 1.
     * 2. Use Math.random to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
     * 3. If the number generated is greater than user input, then the damage
     * doubles.
     * 4. Otherwise, a regular attack ocurred.
     * 
     * Bonus 2:
     * Iterate infinitely Until a User Quits (types "done")
