     * String array guns
     * Integer array damages
     * 
     * Task:
     * Create the three above arrays of size 5.
     * Assign them values as you'd like.
     * The indexes of guns and damages correlate. For example, the damage of guns[0] is damages[0].
     * Print the gun with the highest damage. If two guns have the same top damage, print either one.
     * 
     * Bonus 1:
     * Randomize the damage values to between 0 and 99.
